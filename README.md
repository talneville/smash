# smash
a small shell

includes the following files:

Commands.h/Commands.cpp: The supported commands of smash, each command is represented by a class that inherits from either BuiltInCommand or ExternalCommand. Each command has a virtual method called execute, that executes the command.
signals.h/signals.cpp: Declares and implements requires signal handlers: SIGINT handler to handle Ctr+C and SIGTSTP to handle Ctrl+Z.
smash.cpp: Contains the smash main, which runs an infinite loop that receives the next typed command and sends it to SmallShell::executeCommand to handle it.
Makefile: builds and tests using a basic test your smash. You can use "make zip" to prepare a zip file for submission; this is recommended, which makes sure you follow our submission's structure.
test_input1.txt / test_expected_output1.txt: basic test files that being used by the given Makefile to run a basic test on your smash implementation.

We use a few known design patterns for making the code modular and readable, mainly the Singleton and Factory Method.
